# About My Range Application (MyRA) for iOS (iPad)
![Alt Text](https://github.com/bcgov/range-ios/blob/master/readmeFiles/Home.png)

The Range Mobile Pathfinder project is developing a suite of applications to support the sustainable management of rangelands in British Columbia. [Learn more about the Range Program](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hra/)

The goal is to move important crown land management documents from paper to digital, and to make this information accessible in the field through disconnected mobile devices. This also supports a new and consistent process for Range staff across the province to support decision making processes.

An Agile Scrum team is developing the Alpha product to test basic fuctions after March 31, 2018. Future releases will lead towards an application that can be used by staff and public range use agreement holders, on multiple platforms.

- [For the latest product vision and feature roadmap, please see our RealtimeBoard](https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9J_kzhjVKg=/) 

For the Alpha Release, the **iOS application** documented here will allow Range Branch Staff to create a new Range Use Plan (RUP) associated with an existing tenure agreement. The application will pull basic existing information from a database and will allow for the contribution of new information while the app is online or offline. If offline, the data will be stored locally, and synched with the database when connected.
